Hi, welcome to The official version of Earth Clicker Lite.
This is Earth Clicker, that you can install, but that still needs an internet connection.
        <h1>A few bugs ocurred during the developement time, so you can only play Earth Clicker on the itch.io page, fixing the bug soon, and you will not even need to update the app, Redirecting in 3 seconds...</h1>
